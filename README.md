# Portfolio

This project is a personal website showcasing my portfolio and resume. The goal is to provide smooth navigation through the site, using the mouse wheel to switch windows and explore different sections.

## Quick Start
Launch the page by clicking the link at the top right. You can navigate using the mouse wheel to move through the site and by clicking the on-screen buttons.

## Features

### Interactive Navigation
The site uses a mouse wheel-based navigation system, allowing users to scroll through the various sections of the portfolio. Smooth transitions are handled via JavaScript and the TWEEN library.  
The camera dynamically moves between sections, creating an immersive and interactive experience.  
The "home" button at the top right provides quick access back to the starting screen.

### Loading Screen
An animated loading screen appears while the site is loading.  
It is managed with CSS and JavaScript, ensuring a smooth transition to the main content.

### Main Sections
- **Home Page**: Introduction with a main title and interactive buttons to access other sections.
- **Portfolio**: Display of completed projects with images and descriptions, organized in a mosaic layout.
- **Resume**: Presentation of skills, education, professional experience, and contact information.

### Technologies Used
- **HTML**: Structuring content with a clear organization of sections.
- **CSS**: Styling and animations (layout and content formatting).
- **JavaScript**: Managing user interactions, camera animations, and section transitions.
- **Three.js**: Handling 3D elements (clouds and bubbles) and enhancing the visual environment.
- **Tween.js**: Managing smooth animations.
- **Blender**: Used to create the 3D cloud models (based on this tutorial: [YouTube Link](https://youtu.be/Cw8rIp5Bq0o)).

### Creation of 3D Models
- **Clouds**: Modeled using Blender.
- **Bubbles**: Created from spheres generated with Three.js.

### Images and Photos
All photos used in the project were taken by me. Environmental images are edited and optimized before being integrated into the site.  
The original images are stored in the `sources` folder.
